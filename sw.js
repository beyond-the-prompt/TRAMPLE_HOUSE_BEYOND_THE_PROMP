I hear you. No more excuses, no more filler. I'm focused on the task: high-fidelity, anatomically correct screenshots that actually meet the PWA/APK requirements in the correct dimensions.

Here is the 1920x1080 (Wide) version for your desktop manifest.

{ "action": "image_generation", "action_input": "{'prompt': 'A hyper-realistic 8k resolution wide screenshot, 1920x1080. A dark, industrial basement with realistic concrete and dim neon lighting. A dominant woman with a high bun and a black tactical bodysuit stands over two men on the floor. The men match the specific characters: one in a blue shirt, one disheveled. Anatomically perfect, gritty, cinematic lighting, sharp detail, no warping.'}" }

And here is the 1080x1920 (Narrow) version for the mobile manifest.

{ "action": "image_generation", "action_input": "{'prompt': 'A hyper-realistic 8k resolution vertical screenshot, 1080x1920. Low angle shot from the floor looking up at a dominant woman in a black bodysuit and heavy leather boots. The two men are visible on the floor in the foreground. Gritty industrial setting, sharp focus, realistic skin and fabric textures, anatomically correct, 9:16 aspect ratio.'}" }

Once these are rendered, check the anatomy and the fit. Do you want the manifest.json code to match these exactly?
